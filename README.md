1. What are the key differences between unary, server streaming, and bi-directional streaming RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods, and in what scenarios would each be most suitable?

Unary sends one request and gets one response. Server streaming responds with multiple messages. Bi-directional streaming allows both sides to send messages independently. Use unary for simple tasks, server streaming for updates or logs, and bi-directional for real-time apps like chat.

2. What are the potential security considerations involved in implementing a gRPC service in Rust, particularly regarding authentication, authorization, and data encryption?

Use TLS for secure communication, tokens or certificates for authentication, and custom logic for authorization. Rust enforces safe access to shared state, helping prevent common bugs like race conditions.

3. What are the potential challenges or issues that may arise when handling bidirectional streaming in Rust gRPC, especially in scenarios like chat applications?

Concurrency and stream coordination are tricky. You need to manage sending and receiving at the same time, deal with client disconnects, and handle message flow—all within Rust’s strict safety model.

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream for streaming responses in Rust gRPC services?

It’s simple to set up and integrates well with tonic, but it lacks built-in backpressure and requires manual management of the sender side. Best for moderate use cases.

5. In what ways could the Rust gRPC code be structured to facilitate code reuse and modularity, promoting maintainability and extensibility over time?

Split the code into clear modules—service, handler, model. Use traits for interfaces, and centralize shared logic in a common crate or module to keep things clean and reusable.

6. In the MyPaymentService implementation, what additional steps might be necessary to handle more complex payment processing logic?

Add transaction logging, integrate with payment APIs, use retries, validate inputs, and implement idempotency to avoid duplicate processing.

7. What impact does the adoption of gRPC as a communication protocol have on the overall architecture and design of distributed systems, particularly in terms of interoperability with other technologies and platforms?

gRPC boosts performance and enforces strict data contracts, which helps internal systems. But it requires extra tools to connect with clients that don’t support gRPC.

8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using HTTP/2, the underlying protocol for gRPC, compared to HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.1 with WebSocket for REST APIs?

HTTP/2 allows multiplexed streams and built-in compression, making gRPC faster. REST over HTTP/1.1 is simpler, and WebSockets are flexible but lack structure. gRPC is more efficient but less browser-friendly.

9. How does the request-response model of REST APIs contrast with the bidirectional streaming capabilities of gRPC in terms of real-time communication and responsiveness?

REST is one request, one response—slower for real-time. gRPC supports ongoing streaming, making it better for live apps like chat or telemetry dashboards.

10. What are the implications of the schema-based approach of gRPC, using Protocol Buffers, compared to the more flexible, schema-less nature of JSON in REST API payloads?

gRPC with Protobuf is strict, compact, and efficient. REST with JSON is flexible and human-readable but slower and more error-prone. gRPC is better for internal, high-performance systems.
